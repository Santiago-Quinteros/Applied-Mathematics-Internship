Developed a mathematical method to extract the knee’s rotation axis for the design of custom knee prostheses by fitting 3D quadratic functions to femur model point clouds. 

Improved the robustness and the precision of the existing axis-extraction method by 2º.

Automated the extraction of 3 anatomical angles for intraoperative software.
